# Flow schema structure

1. **Basic Properties**:
   - `id`: Unique identifier for the flow
   - `title`: Name of the flow for display purposes
   - `enabled`: Toggle to activate or deactivate the flow

2. **Nodes**: The building blocks of the flow, each with a specific purpose:
   - **Data Source Nodes** (`type: "data_source"`): Define the input sources for data
   - **Initiate Attributes Nodes** (`type: "initiate_attributes"`): Process and transform data
   - **Output Endpoint Nodes** (`type: "output_endpoint"`): Define where processed data is sent

3. **Edges**: Connect nodes together to define the flow of data

## Node Types in Detail

### Data Source Node

- Acts as the entry point for data from devices
- Contains a list of source device IDs to monitor
- Example use: Collect data from vehicle trackers, temperature sensors, etc.

### Initiate Attributes Node

- Processes data by creating or modifying attributes
- Uses expressions to transform raw data into meaningful metrics
- Can reference other attributes in calculations
- Example use: Convert analog signals to meaningful metrics (fuel level, temperature)

### Output Endpoint Node

- Defines the destination for processed data
- Two main types:
  - **Navixy Output**: Sends data to the Navixy platform
  - **MQTT Client Output**: Sends data to external MQTT brokers

## Customization for Manufacturers

This template can be customized for different manufacturers by:

1. **Adjusting attribute calculations** to match the specific sensor outputs and units of a particular manufacturer's devices
2. **Adding manufacturer-specific attributes** that may be unique to certain vehicles or devices
3. **Configuring appropriate endpoints** based on the manufacturer's preferred data handling systems

For example, if adapting for a specific truck manufacturer, you might:

- Adjust fuel calculations based on their specific tank sizes and sensor characteristics
- Add attributes for manufacturer-specific features (e.g., DEF levels, regeneration status)
- Configure outputs to integrate with their fleet management systems
